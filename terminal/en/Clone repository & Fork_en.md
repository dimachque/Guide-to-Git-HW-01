# Clone Repository

### Clone the repository (files are extracted to the location where the terminal was opened)

```bash
git clone 'link to repository'
```

---

### Download the latest changes from the remote repository (if someone from the team pushed changes while you were away)

```bash
git pull
```

* ### Essentially, this is a combination of creating and cloning a repository:
    
    + Made a fork;
    + Copied the link;
    + Opened the terminal;
    + Pasted the link;
    + Downloaded.
